# Futures were introduced in Python 3.2 in the `concurrent.futures` package.
# This package has also been backported to older versions of Python and can be
# installed with `pip install futures`. Tornado uses concurrent.futures if
# available; otherwise it will use a compatible class defined in this
# tornado.concurrent. We want to test all cases: with and without the 'futures'
# package installed in Python < 3.2, as well as Python >= 3.2.
